Low-cost carriers usually offer a smaller number of routes as well as no-frills service to their customers. Regional carriers typically operate under contract to full-servicecarriers, expanding the network of the larger carriers. Many airline companies also have a cargo segment in their operations from which they generate additional revenue. It is common within the industry for companies to form partnerships or join alliances in order to increase network size. Operating as an alliance allows airlines to offer customers access to international or otherwise underserved itineraries on multiple airlines under one ticket. At the same time, airlines share some overhead costs and increase their competitive position in the global market without having to operate outside their home country."

Landside infrastructure accommodates the movement of ground-based vehicles and passengers, including access roads, parking lots, garages, aviation and non-aviation related businesses, support and terminal buildings. Air passenger traffic and the number of aircrafts handled by airports across the world is increasing every year, resulting in overcrowding and struggling airports. There is an increasing need to expand existing airport infrastructure to cater for future growth. It is predicted that demand is likely to grow in smaller cities which have plans to construct new airports and current airports look to make longer runways, more gate capacity and modernise air traffic control systems."

        "short_description": "Companies in this industry rent or lease passenger vehicles to customers. Car rentals are typically for periods of less than a month, while leases are for a year or more. The industry includes car-sharing business models where rentals are measured hourly and typically include subscription fees. Car rental companies operate out of airport locations, which serve business and leisure travellers, and out of neighbourhood locations, which mostly provide repair-shop and weekend rentals. The industry is concentrated, with several dominant market players, who operate globally using a franchise model. The growth of public transit and ride-sharing services in major metropolitan areas may represent a threat to the long-term profitability of the Car Rental & Leasing industry if customers chose to hail rides or take public transit rather than rent vehicles."

        "short_description": "The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry is made up of gas distribution and marketing companies. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing companies are gas brokers that aggregate natural gas into quantities that ft the needs of their different customers and then deliver it, generally through other companies\u2019 transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are commonly used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial, and industrial customers. In structurally regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to avoid the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are legally separated and customers have a choice of which company to buy their gas from. In this case, a utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is legally required to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, companies in the industry are tasked with providing safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions. Note: The SASB Gas Utilities & Distributors industry does not include gas transmission companies that transport highly pressurised natural gas over long distances from the wellhead. Gas transmission companies are included in the Oil & Gas - Midstream industry (EM-MD) in the Extractives & Minerals Processing sector."

Insurance companies generally operate within a single segment in the industry, e.g., property and casualty, although there are some large insurance companies with diversified operations. Similarly, companies may vary based on the level of their geographic segmentation. While large companies may underwrite insurance premiums in multiple countries, smaller companies generally operate at a national or even local level. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue, and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance companies provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling, and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance companies, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, lowering incentives to improve underlying behavior and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability impacts. Similar to other financial institutions, insurance companies face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, companies that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, have been identified by regulators as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and subsequently, more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, insurance companies face the potential of being designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to enhanced regulation and oversight."
